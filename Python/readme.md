What is Inheritance:

    Inheritance is a way where a class passes its methods to children.
    inheritance is a mechanism where a child class inherits functionality from parent class
    when a class extends another class the child class inherits methods and properties of the parent class,
    this is called inheritance
    the child class has access methods and properties from the parent class

What are Encapsulation and Access Modifiers? Explain with examples:

    Encapsulation is a way to abstract class implementation and making sure no unwanted methods and properties are easily update-able.
    and Access Modifiers are used for hiding and restricting the abusing class and making sure some methods / properties are not access-able from public.
